# Zaxxon

This is a toy neural net implementation in Elixir that I'm building with
a vague understanding of how these things work. Just tiptoeing into it and
feeling my way around.

I called it "Zaxxon" because I'm building from the bottom up and wasn't 100%
sure what exactly I'm building. Needed a word, "Zaxxon" sounds cool, not
rewriting git history over it.
